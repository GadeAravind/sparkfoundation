      <b>Western and Southern India</b> are reeling from widespread flooding.
      The death toll is expected to rise as 60 lives were already claimed. Water
      entering basements of apartments has destroyed 20,540 homes, in 144
      colonies, affecting the lives of 35,000 families (almost quarter of a
      million people). The City of Hyderabad, in the State of Telagana, is
      facing the brunt of the devastation with heavy rainfall. Damage to
      infrastructure, mainly homes and businesses, poses a threat to families
      seeking safety from the rising waters. An estimated $272+ million in
      damages has been reported. Helping Hand USA has launched its Hyderabad
      India Floods Relief Campaign to help victims, with the assistance of our
      local vetted NGOs, with food-&-water, hygiene kits, medical assistance,
      and more.
